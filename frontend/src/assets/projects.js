      "A distributed messaging backbone for event-driven systems using Kafka and Redis.",
    content: `
<p>The <strong>Event Exchange Framework</strong> is a <em>distributed messaging backbone</em> designed to facilitate seamless data flow between different systems. It enables users to <strong>receive, process, and transmit events</strong> across predefined sources and destinations, allowing the creation of <strong>customized data processing pipelines</strong> with minimal effort.</p>

    <h2>Problem It Solves</h2>
    <p>Many applications require <strong>real-time data exchange</strong> between multiple systems, but managing message communication efficiently across distributed architectures can be complex. This framework <strong>simplifies event-driven communication</strong>, ensuring <strong>reliable, scalable, and structured data processing</strong> through its modular design of <em>receivers, processors, and senders</em>.</p>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Receivers</strong> (Web Hook, Web API, Web Pull, Stream RTSP) <em>ingest data</em> from external systems into <strong>message topics</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Processors</strong> (such as a relay) <em>consume and process</em> events before passing them to the next stage.</li>
        <li><strong>Senders</strong> (e.g., Web Post) <em>transmit processed events</em> to external systems over HTTP.</li>
        <li>The <strong>Topic Console UI</strong> allows users to <em>monitor and manage</em> event topics, processors, and senders.</li>
        <li>The <strong>eStore (Event Exchange Store)</strong> serves as a <em>central storage</em> for logs, metadata, and mappings related to the event pipeline.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Messaging & Event Handling:</strong> Custom message topics for structured data flow</li>
        <li><strong>Data Ingestion:</strong> Web API, Web Hooks, Streaming (RTSP)</li>
        <li><strong>Processing:</strong> Relay-based event transformation</li>
        <li><strong>Delivery Mechanisms:</strong> HTTP API calls to external systems</li>
        <li><strong>Monitoring & Storage:</strong> Topic Console UI, eStore for logs and metadata</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This framework is ideal for <strong>real-time event-driven applications</strong>, <strong>data pipelines</strong>, and <strong>distributed system integrations</strong> where structured messaging and reliable communication are essential. üöÄ</p>

    content:
      `<h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The <strong>Intelligent Violation Detection & Alert System</strong> is an AI-powered platform that uses the 
        <strong>Event Exchange Framework</strong> to stream real-time data from surveillance cameras across multiple sites. 
        By applying <strong>AI/ML models</strong>, the system detects violations and automatically sends alerts to the 
        designated point of contact. 
    </p>
    <p>
        A <strong>central cloud server</strong> collects all violation data from different locations, enabling 
        multi-user access with <strong>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)</strong> for in-depth analysis and reporting. 
    </p>

    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Real-Time Video Streaming:</strong> Captures and processes live camera feeds using the Event Exchange Framework.</li>

        <li><strong>Violation Detection & Alerting:</strong> Identified violations trigger instant alerts to the appropriate personnel.</li>
        <li><strong>Centralized Storage:</strong> All detected violations are stored in a cloud database for further review.</li>
        <li><strong>Role-Based Access & Monitoring:</strong> Authorized users access violation data based on predefined roles.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Event Streaming & Processing:</strong> Event Exchange Framework, Kafka</li>
        <li><strong>AI/ML for Violation Detection:</strong> TensorFlow, OpenCV, YOLO</li>
        <li><strong>Backend & Data Storage:</strong> Node.js, Python, Redis, MariaDB</li>
        <li><strong>Cloud Infrastructure:</strong> AWS, GCP, Azure</li>
        <li><strong>RBAC & Security:</strong> JWT Authentication, Role-Based Access Control</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Use This System?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>üöÄ <strong>Automates violation detection</strong> using AI, reducing manual effort.</li>
