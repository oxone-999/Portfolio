<p>The <strong>Event Exchange Framework</strong> is a <em>distributed messaging backbone</em> designed to facilitate seamless data flow between different systems. It enables users to <strong>receive, process, and transmit events</strong> across predefined sources and destinations, allowing the creation of <strong>customized data processing pipelines</strong> with minimal effort.</p>

    <h2>Problem It Solves</h2>
    <p>Many applications require <strong>real-time data exchange</strong> between multiple systems, but managing message communication efficiently across distributed architectures can be complex. This framework <strong>simplifies event-driven communication</strong>, ensuring <strong>reliable, scalable, and structured data processing</strong> through its modular design of <em>receivers, processors, and senders</em>.</p>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Receivers</strong> (Web Hook, Web API, Web Pull, Stream RTSP) <em>ingest data</em> from external systems into <strong>message topics</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Processors</strong> (such as a relay) <em>consume and process</em> events before passing them to the next stage.</li>
        <li><strong>Senders</strong> (e.g., Web Post) <em>transmit processed events</em> to external systems over HTTP.</li>
        <li>The <strong>Topic Console UI</strong> allows users to <em>monitor and manage</em> event topics, processors, and senders.</li>
        <li>The <strong>eStore (Event Exchange Store)</strong> serves as a <em>central storage</em> for logs, metadata, and mappings related to the event pipeline.</li>

<p><strong>DFB Streaming Pipeline</strong> is a <em>live event streaming architecture</em> designed to ingest, process, enhance, and distribute football match streams to multiple broadcasters using flexible configurations and protocols.</p>

<h2>Project Purpose</h2>
<p>This pipeline enables real-time acquisition and transformation of live football match streams received from production companies in formats like <strong>HLS, SRT, and RTMP</strong>. It enhances the streams with <strong>multilingual audio and subtitles</strong>, and delivers them to broadcasters in their desired format and quality.</p>

<h2>How It Works</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Streams are ingested from external production sources using the <strong>Receiver Adapters</strong> (SRT, HLS, RTMP).</li>
  <li>Data passes through the <strong>Event Exchange Framework</strong> for pipeline handling using Kafka topics and Redis caching.</li>
  <li>The pipeline <strong>processes video streams</strong>, applies audio/subtitle overlays, and transforms them using <strong>FFmpeg</strong>.</li>
  <li>Output is sent via <strong>Sender Adapters</strong> to broadcasters in configurable formats.</li>
  <li><strong>Monitoring and performance metrics</strong> are tracked through the ELK stack (Logstash, Elasticsearch, Kibana).</li>
</ul>

<h2>My Contributions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Developed custom <strong>Receiver and Sender Adapters</strong> for live stream protocols including <strong>SRT and HLS</strong>.</li>
  <li>Researched and implemented stream transformation logic for optimal live video quality.</li>
  <li>Collaborated on adapting <strong>FFmpeg</strong> pipelines for real-time transcoding and protocol conversion.</li>
  <li>Ensured integration of <strong>Event Exchange</strong> messaging components for stable stream lifecycle management.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Streaming Protocols:</strong> SRT, HLS, RTMP</li>
  <li><strong>Media Processing:</strong> FFmpeg, NGINX (RTMP module)</li>
  <li><strong>Framework:</strong> Event Exchange (Kafka, Redis, Topic Console, eStore)</li>
  <li><strong>Logic Layer:</strong> Python for processing and control flow</li>
  <li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> Logstash, Elasticsearch, Kibana (ELK Stack)</li>

<p>The <strong>Sports Stream Management Console</strong> is a full-featured <em>real-time pipeline orchestration platform</em> built using <strong>React, Node.js, and TypeScript</strong>. It serves as the management interface for the <strong>DFB Streaming Pipeline</strong>, enabling technical and non-technical users to control and monitor live football streaming infrastructure without writing code.</p>

<h2>Problem It Solves</h2>
<p>The original streaming pipeline required <strong>manual intervention</strong> for:
  <ul>
    <li>Starting/stopping Docker services</li>
    <li>Editing config files manually</li>
    <li>Debugging logs via command line</li>
    <li>Maintaining client/pipeline data externally</li>
  </ul>
  Additionally, there was no <strong>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)</strong>, no client management, and no persistent storage for pipeline configurations. The system was highly developer-dependent.
</p>

<h2>Why This Was Built</h2>
<p>To solve these issues, we designed a <strong>scalable and intuitive UI-based application</strong> that supports:
  <ul>
    <li>Pipeline lifecycle management (Create, Start, Stop, Delete, Update)</li>
    <li>Configuration persistence</li>
    <li>Stream categorization (Upcoming, InProgress, Completed)</li>
    <li>Live log streaming for debugging</li>
    <li>RBAC-based user and client management</li>
    <li>System-wide notifications and alerts</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2>My Contributions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Designed and implemented key backend services using <strong>Node.js</strong> with <strong>TypeScript</strong></li>
  <li>Built REST APIs to integrate with the <strong>Event Exchange Framework</strong></li>
  <li>Configured <strong>MariaDB</strong> for persistent pipeline and user data</li>
  <li>Worked on <strong>Dockerizing the entire application</strong>, including DIND for internal service orchestration</li>
  <li>Implemented client onboarding and live pipeline view with real-time stream statuses</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> React + TypeScript</li>
  <li><strong>Backend:</strong> Node.js + TypeScript</li>
  <li><strong>Database:</strong> MariaDB</li>
  <li><strong>Containerization:</strong> Docker, Docker-in-Docker (DIND)</li>
  <li><strong>Others:</strong> REST API, WebSocket (for live logs), Role-Based Access Control</li>
</ul>

<p>This console enables true <strong>self-service DevOps</strong> for real-time media pipelines and eliminates manual effort, making it scalable and maintainable even by non-developers. ‚öôÔ∏èüì∫</p>
